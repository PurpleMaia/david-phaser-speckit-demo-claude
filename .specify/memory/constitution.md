# Phaser 3 SpecKit Demo Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simplicity First

Every implementation choice MUST prioritize simplicity over features, flexibility, or
optimization. When faced with a decision between a "fancy feature" and a "simple, robust
implementation", always choose simple.

- Code MUST be readable and self-explanatory
- Project structure MUST remain minimal and standard
- New abstractions are prohibited unless strictly necessary to avoid duplication
- Premature optimization is prohibited

**Rationale**: This is a proof-of-concept demo for SpecKit + Codex CLI. The goal is to
demonstrate workflow, not build a production game. Simple code ensures the demo remains
understandable and maintainable.

### II. Minimal Dependencies

The project MUST avoid adding new libraries or dependencies unless strictly necessary for
core functionality.

- Phaser 3 and Vite (or equivalent modern bundler) are the only approved non-trivial dependencies
- Standard npm tooling (scripts, dev server) is permitted
- Each proposed dependency MUST include written justification explaining why existing tools
  cannot solve the problem

**Rationale**: Keeping dependencies minimal reduces bundle size, simplifies setup, ensures
the demo runs reliably with just `npm install && npm run dev`, and prevents scope creep.

### III. Code-Generated SVG Assets (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All visual assets MUST be SVGs generated by code. Bitmap files (.png, .jpg, etc.) are
strictly prohibited.

- SVGs MUST be defined as inline `<svg>` strings or as separate `.js` modules exporting
  SVG strings
- Phaser MUST load them via data URIs or equivalent pipeline (no external file loading)
- Art style MUST be extremely simple: colored shapes, basic icons, geometric primitives
- No attempt at "good art" is required or expected

**Rationale**: Code-generated SVGs eliminate asset management complexity, keep the repository
lightweight, ensure reproducibility, and align with the experimental/demo nature of the
project.

### IV. Local-First Execution

The entire project MUST run locally without external dependencies, servers, or databases.

- Frontend-only web app (no backend, no API calls, no database)
- `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` (or equivalent) MUST be sufficient to run
- All game state MUST be client-side only (browser memory, localStorage if needed)
- No network requests during gameplay

**Rationale**: Local-first ensures the demo is portable, works offline, requires no
infrastructure, and can be easily shared, cloned, and run by anyone.

### V. Standard Project Structure

Project organization MUST follow standard conventions for modern JavaScript web projects.

- Clear separation: `src/` (source code), `public/` or `assets/` (if needed for build output)
- Entry point clearly identified (e.g., `src/main.js` or `src/index.js`)
- Configuration files at repository root (package.json, vite.config.js, etc.)
- README.md MUST explain how to run the game and what to expect

**Rationale**: Standard structure makes the project immediately familiar to developers,
reduces cognitive load, and demonstrates best practices for SpecKit-managed projects.

## Technical Constraints

### Toolchain

- **Framework**: Phaser 3 (latest stable version)
- **Build Tool**: Vite + JavaScript (TypeScript permitted only if strongly justified)
- **Package Manager**: npm (lock file required)
- **Target Environment**: Modern browsers (ES2020+, no IE support needed)

### Asset Pipeline

- SVG definitions in `src/assets/` as `.js` modules exporting strings
- Data URI conversion handled in asset loader or build pipeline
- No external file loading during runtime
- No sprite sheets or texture atlases unless code-generated

### Testing

- Testing is OPTIONAL for this demo project
- If included, a minimal sanity test (e.g., script assertion, smoke test) is sufficient
- Testing MUST NOT block delivery of a running demo
- Focus on "does it run and display something" over comprehensive coverage

## Development Workflow

### Decision Framework

When making implementation choices, apply this decision tree:

1. **Does it add complexity?** → If yes, reject unless absolutely required
2. **Does it require a new dependency?** → If yes, document justification or find simpler alternative
3. **Does it increase bundle size significantly?** → If yes, evaluate if benefit justifies cost
4. **Does it make the code harder to read?** → If yes, choose clearer alternative

### Quality Standards

- Code MUST be formatted consistently (use Prettier or equivalent)
- README MUST be kept up-to-date with setup and run instructions
- Commit messages SHOULD be clear and descriptive
- Bundle size SHOULD remain reasonable but optimization is not a priority

### Scope Control

- Feature requests MUST be evaluated against "Simplicity First" principle
- Any feature that cannot be implemented in <100 lines of clear code requires justification
- Game mechanics MUST remain minimal: basic movement, simple interactions, tiny world
- This is a demo, not a game: prefer "proof of concept" over "complete experience"

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure

1. Constitution changes MUST be documented with version bump rationale
2. Breaking changes to principles require MAJOR version increment
3. New principles or expanded guidance require MINOR version increment
4. Clarifications and typo fixes require PATCH version increment
5. All amendments MUST include Sync Impact Report updating dependent templates

### Compliance Review

- All feature specifications MUST reference relevant constitutional principles
- Implementation plans MUST include "Constitution Check" section validating compliance
- Any principle violation MUST be explicitly justified in planning documents
- Code reviews SHOULD verify adherence to Simplicity First and Minimal Dependencies principles

### Versioning

This constitution uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible governance changes, principle removals/redefinitions
- **MINOR**: New principles added, materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-24 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-24
